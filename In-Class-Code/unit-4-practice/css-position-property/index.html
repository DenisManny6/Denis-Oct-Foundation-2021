            <b>staticis</b> the default value. An element with the position static; 
            is not <i>positioned </i>in any special way. A static element is said 
            to be NOT postioned and an element with its position set to anything else 
            is said to be positioned static.
        </div>

        <div class="first-relative">
            <h1>Relative</h1>
            Setting the <i>top, bottom, left, and right</i> properties 
            of a <b>relatively-positioned</b> element will cause it to be 
            adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be 
            adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

        <div class="third-relative">
            <h1>Neartest ancestor element to the Absolutely positioned element</h1>

            This element is relatively-positioed. If this element was positioned <i>static</i>; 
            its absolutely positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative 
            to the domument body.

            <div class="absolute">
                absolute behaves like <i>fixed</i> except it's <i>relative</i> 
                to the nearest <i>positioned</i> ancestor element instead of relative 
                to the viewport.If an absolutely positioned element has no positioned 
                element ancestors, then
